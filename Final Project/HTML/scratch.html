<!--TO DO
    1. Remove otherpage.html. The goal for this page is that it is the "other page" of the professional looking website. 
    2. Instructions from My Educator
    From-scratch page:
This page must be created from a blank HTML file.
It can be about anything. Pick a hobby, or a passion, or something that fascinates you.
It must include the following as a demonstration of your ability to write HTML and CSS:
        Y- An unordered list embedded in an ordered list (or the other way around)
        Y- At least one image not from the Bootstrap theme (feel free to have many more)
        Y - An embedded YouTube video (we intentionally didn’t teach you this, so you would have to figure it out—good learning experience)
        Y- An on-page anchor
        Y - A custom background color or background image
        Y - You also need to link to (and apply) a stylesheet that you have created from scratch. This stylesheet should include:
        - At least four style definitions (it is possible you will have many more than four styles)
        Y - Styles that specify font color
        Y - Styles that specify font family
        Y - At least three divs for positioning and styling blocks of content in the HTML page
        Y- A live and interactive embedded Tableau graph (not just a picture of one).
            This graph can be about anything. It doesn’t have to be a graph you created, although it certainly can be.
A quick Google search will show you where to find cool Tableau visualizations.
        Y- Navigation back to the professional-looking pages.
Your professional-looking pages do not need to link to the scratch page (but you will submit the url to your scratch page). This way you can use the professional side for whatever you want without worrying someone might find this scratch page… 
If you are a graduate student, you must also include a link on this scratch page to your extra page (see below).

<!--Introductory Paragraph-->
        <h2>What is a Gear?</h2>
    A gear on a GSX pinsetter serves a critical role in the operation of this bowling equipment. The GSX pinsetter, a modern, automated device used in bowling alleys, relies on gears as part of its mechanical system to ensure the precise functioning of various components. These gears work by transmitting torque and motion between different parts of the machine, enabling the efficient and synchronized handling of bowling pins and balls during gameplay. Without the gears, the pinsetter would lack the mechanical coordination needed to perform its complex tasks reliably.
    <br><br>
    <h2>What is its Purpose?</h2>
    One primary purpose of a gear in the GSX pinsetter is to manage the rotation and movement of parts like the pin table, sweep bar, and ball return system. Gears convert the power generated by a motor into controlled rotational movement, ensuring these components move in harmony. This coordination is essential for tasks like resetting pins into their proper positions and clearing knocked-over pins from the lane. By providing consistent and measured motion, the gears prevent jerky or irregular movements that could disrupt gameplay.
    <br><br>
    Another vital role of the gears is to amplify or reduce force within the pinsetter. Depending on the size and configuration of the gears, they can either increase torque for heavy lifting (such as repositioning pins) or speed up rotations for smoother, faster movements (like sweeping fallen pins). This adaptability allows the GSX pinsetter to handle a wide range of operational demands, from the delicate placement of pins to the robust motion needed to clear the lane swiftly.
    <br><br>
    <h2>Benefits of Maintaining Your Gears</h2>
    The gears also contribute to the durability and longevity of the pinsetter. By distributing mechanical stress across multiple components, gears reduce wear and tear on individual parts. This not only minimizes maintenance requirements but also ensures the machine operates consistently over long periods. High-quality, well-maintained gears are critical in maintaining the reliability of the GSX pinsetter, particularly in busy bowling alleys where the machine is in constant use.
    <br><br>
    In addition to functional roles, the gears play a part in reducing noise and vibration within the GSX pinsetter. Properly aligned and lubricated gears ensure smooth motion, which minimizes disruptive sounds and shaking. This is especially important in a bowling alley environment, where excessive machine noise could detract from the player experience. The quiet operation facilitated by the gears contributes to a more pleasant atmosphere for players and spectators alike.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, gears in the GSX pinsetter allow for customization and adjustments to suit different operational needs. By altering gear ratios, technicians can fine-tune the speed and torque of specific components, optimizing the pinsetter for various bowling styles or facility requirements. This flexibility makes the gear system not only a functional necessity but also a tool for enhancing the overall efficiency and user experience of the GSX pinsetter.
